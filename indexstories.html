                  <p style="display:inline"><em>Rubaroo taught me something that is invaluable, a way of living life. 
                    It gave me the space to fight over my anxiety while doing my Social Action Project by interacting with 
                    others and exchanging ideas throughout. Previously I have believed that 'Interfaith' only meant one 
                    religion and that religion is mine, but I have now learnt that it means 'humanity'.I read about Sikhism,
                    Buddhism, Christianity, and I have come to realize that every religion advocates that each one should be
                    equally treated with love.
                    <br>
                    ~ Arif, participant - Agaaz-e-Baatcheet 2017</em></p>
                    <p class="collapse" id="block-id1"><em>
                      <br>
                      Agaaz-e-baatcheet was the stepping stone towards change within myself.
                      It taught me to see myself before pointing at someone else. I have explored religions, 
                      through many religious facts which were not known to me. It is my journey from being an
                      Atheist to being a Monotheist. I have seen that religions are not different actually, but 
                      their way of expression is different. To create interfaith among people is to create 
                      interfaith in your soul.
