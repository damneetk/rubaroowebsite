            “The five days Orientation Camp were an eye opener and a massive learning experience.
            It gave me a first hand overview and understanding of the life and hardships of the people 
            living in the rural areas. The kinds and extent of discriminations that we witnessed over there
            was overwhelming and shocking. The various activities at camp were very thought provoking and 
            helped me broaden my horizon. <a href="#hidden" data-toggle="collapse">Continue...</a>
            <div id="hidden" class="collapse">It made me think from different kinds of perspectives and instigated 
            me to think in ways I would never have thought before. It helped me come out of my comfort zone
            and push myself to work towards new boundaries. The camp gave me a great deal of understanding 
            of the ways of the world, how interdependent and interlinked each aspect of the society is and 
            unjust treatment certain sects of the society have to undergo. The shramdaan was a totally new 
            experience. It filled me with a sense of satisfaction and fulfilment as I was finally able to 
            give back a little to the place that had provided me shelter for the five days. I learnt a lot 
            from the people there. They had bare minimum but still made sure we never felt uncomfortable and 
            had all the possible comforts. The love and warmth with which they welcomed us and did not let
            language or any other barriers hinder their friendship and love towards us was heart touching 
            and made me feel very special. It felt like we belonged with them. This camp also made me learn 
            to be sensitive to others around and not be judgemental. It made me value and appreciate all the 
            others who were at the camp along with me, for what they were. The camp made me understand that
            life is a lot more than money. Interacting with the Spanish students gave me another view on the
            same aspects that we had been exploring at camp. It also gave me an exposure to the kind of 
            life students in Spain lead. It made me further realise the futility of the so called “language
            barrier”.If there is the desire there will definitely be ways to communicate, interact and 
            form a bond with the other. No sort of barrier can restrict you.” <b>~ Anandini Gupta</b></em></p>

            <br>
            It  has been a beautiful journey  and an amazing box of memories in my head. When I first came for
            the orientation day i did not  have many expectations and I wanted to experience it and not think 
            beforehand what all would happen. This journey taught me many good things, I have always been the
            kind of a person who would not interact with people or even bother making an eye contact.<a href="#hidden2" 
            data-toggle="collapse">Continue...</a><div id="hidden2" class="collapse"> But rubaroo 
             me interact with strangers and it was not as bad as I  thought it would be. I made many new friends 
            who are helpful and kind. Who are understanding and respect my point of views. We had discussions about 
            interfaith, different people and their point of views. It felt really good knowing that i am not the 
            only one who is willing to do something about the unity of religions etc and there are many people who 
            would bring their words into actions. Reach out to people for a better change. It was very kind and
            humble of Mr.Andrews to be a part of our beautiful journey, interact with us and discuss things just
            like he is one among us youth champions. The organizers have been amazingly coordinative and supportive. 
            They have always understood our needs and supported us in every way possible. Now when i turn back and go
            through the amazing flashbacks of rubaroo journey, it gives me a satisfaction that i have atleast tried 
             to bring a change to our indian society.<b>-Safoora</b></em></p>
